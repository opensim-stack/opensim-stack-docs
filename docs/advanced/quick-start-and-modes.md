# Advanced Quick Start

With further options for  getting up and running, this guide shows how you can automate initial setup with environment variables,

## Setup

Clone the [docker composition repository](https://github.com/opensim-stack/opensim-ai-docker) to your workspace.
 
Run:

```bash
cd opensim-ai-docker
./run.sh myhostname
```

or setup manually ..

```bash
cd opensim-ai-docker
cp .env.example .env
OPENSIM_HOSTNAME=myhostname docker compose up -d
```

Browse to (default username is `ConsoleUser` and password is `ConsolePass`). You will be guided through creating your grid, region, bot and user. 

```
http://myhostname:8993
```

### Alternative Setup Methods

You can also skip the setup wizard and have setup automatically performed based on environment variabls (see `.env.example` near the top).

To start a standalone simulator ..

```
OPENSIM_PROVISION_MODE=auto OPENSIM_HOSTNAME=myhostname docker compose up -d
```

Or a ROBUST grid ..

```
OPENSIM_PROVISION_MODE=grid OPENSIM_HOSTNAME=myhostname docker compose up -d
```

## Access Your 3D World

Login with a [Viewer](https://www.firestormviewer.org/) to (default username is `Bot Handler` and password is `changeme`):

```
http://myhostname:9000
```

## When You Are Done

Bring down:

```bash
docker compose down
```

*Or if you want to completely wipe configuration and data ...*

```
docker compose down -v
```
